# IdentifyingAreasOfBiasInDatasets
The intent of this research is to explore different and potentially more intuitive methods of evaluating fairness of different datasets and the potential biases caused by certain features. 

Objectives
The goals of this project are to:
1. Identify, analyze and understand the various softwares, analysis tools, and machine
learning models that can be used to assist the process of quantifying bias.
2. Identify a tool that is able to measure the amount of bias present in a given machine
learning model.
3. Test the tool with a known specific dataset that is known to have sensitive features and
hence the potential to have bias.
